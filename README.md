# Application-of-convolutiona-neural-network-in-control-of-mobile-robots
This repo is a documentation to bachelor thesis "Application of convolutiona neural network in control of mobile robots"


The project consist of few scripts. The first part of the project was to gather the data for training. This was done with Image_Collection_without_install Script and WebScraping. 

After those two there is a need to filtrate the data using Images_filtration.ipynb. This script gets rid of corrupted files.

Next step is Training.ipynb, which prepares model to being trained and trains it. The outcome is a model, which can be used either on the local machine or used in Linux-based environment.

For thests on local machine (windows), the files Real time detection and Detection on Images and from Webcam should be used. Linux (so mobile robot OS) program is in file ""

There are also dataset and models which were used to the bachelor thesis. Enjoy developing! :D
